🧮 How It Works
The bot prompts the user to enter a loan amount in ₹.

Then it asks for the annual interest rate (e.g., 7.5).

Next, it requests the loan term in years (e.g., 20).

Based on the input, it calculates the monthly payment using the formula:

M = (P * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)

Where:
- M = Monthly Payment
- P = Loan Amount
- r = Monthly Interest Rate (annual rate / 12 / 100)
- n = Number of Payments (years * 12)
